The application must address the following requirements:

Include a user interface allowing a user to interact with the binary search tree.
When a user runs the application, it displays a menu and prompts the user to select an option.
The menu options are:
Create a binary search tree
Add a node
Delete a node
Print nodes by InOrder
Print nodes by PreOrder
Print nodes by PostOrder
Exit program
When a user selects 1) Create a binary search tree, the application creates a binary search tree with the given data (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). To keep the binary search tree balanced at all times, follow these rules: (1) the child nodes on the left must have a search key value less than that of the root node and (2) the child nodes on the right must have search key values greater than that of the root node.
The given numbers must be assigned as shown in the figure below.



Binary Search Tree - Balanced Automatically



When a user selects 2) Add a node, the application prompts the user to input a value for the new node. The application needs to insert the value to the existing binary search tree.

When a user selects 3) Delete a node, the application prompts the user to input the value of the node that will be deleted. The application needs to delete the node.

When a user selects 4) Print nodes by InOrder, the application prints the nodes of the current binary search tree by traversing it using in-order traversal.

When a user selects 5) Print nodes by PreOrder, the application prints the nodes of the current binary search tree by traversing it using pre-order traversal.

When a user selects 6) Print nodes by PostOrder, the application prints the nodes of the current binary search tree by traversing it using post-order traversal.

When a user selects 7) Exit program, the application ends.

!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE RUN THIS APPLICATION IN TERMINAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
